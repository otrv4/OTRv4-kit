# UI-Design Ideas

There are three main screens that will need to be updated:

* The conversation: to allow OTR
* The settings: to give the user the option to allow OTR
* Create a new verification screen for allowing authentication for OTR

There should be a logo for encryption (a padlock) and one for authentication/
verification (an 'x' or a check).

## Implementation details

* Might be good to add a test in `ChatSecure-iOS/ChatSecureUITests/ChatSecureUITests.swift`.
